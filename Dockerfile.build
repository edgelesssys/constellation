# This workaround is necessary since glibc in versions >= 2.34 are incompatible with docker versions <= 20.10.9.
# Since the host ubuntu is running docker 20.10.7, this incompatibility becomes a problem.
# The workaround binary is a small go program that adds a missing seccomp filter to all programs invoked through the
# container's shell. More explanations can be found in the clone3-workaround repo and the blogpost linked in the repo.
