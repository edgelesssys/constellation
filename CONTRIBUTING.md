## Build

Prerequisites:

* [Go 1.18](https://go.dev/doc/install)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* Packages on Ubuntu:

  ```sh
  sudo apt install build-essential cmake libssl-dev pkg-config libcryptsetup12 libcryptsetup-dev
  ```

* Packages on Fedora:

  ```sh
  sudo dnf install @development-tools pkg-config cmake openssl-devel cryptsetup-libs cryptsetup-devel
  ```

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j`nproc`
```

## Testing

You can run all integration and unitttests like this:

```sh
ctest -j `nproc`
```

### Debug Images

> :warning: These images are not safe to use in production environments. :warning:

As described in [debugd](/debugd/README.md), it is possible to use a CoreOS image targeted at dev environments. This image allows to upload any [bootstrapper](/bootstrapper/README.md) using [cdbg](/debugd/cdbg).

To enable the upload, an additional **unsecured** port (4000) is opened which accepts any binary to be run on target machine. **Make sure that this machine is not exposed to the internet.**

## Cloud credentials

Using the CLI requires the user to make authorized API calls to the CSP API. See the [docs](https://docs.edgeless.systems/constellation/getting-started/install#set-up-cloud-credentials) for configuration.

## Deploying a locally compiled bootstrapper binary

By default, `constellation create ...` will spawn cloud provider instances with a pre-baked bootstrapper binary.
For testing, you can use the constellation debug daemon (debugd) to upload your local bootstrapper binary to running instances and to obtain SSH access.
[Follow this introduction on how to install and setup `cdbg`](debugd/README.md)

## Linting

This projects uses [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) for linting.
You can [install golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#linux-and-windows) locally,
but there is also a CI action to ensure compliance.

To locally run all configured linters, execute

```sh
golangci-lint run ./...
```

It is also recommended to use golangci-lint (and [gofumpt](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt) as formatter) in your IDE, by adding the recommended VS Code Settings or by [configuring it yourself](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/integrations/#editor-integration)

## Nested Go modules

As this project contains nested Go modules, it is recommended to create a local Go workspace, so your IDE can lint multiple modules at once.

```go
go 1.18

use (
 .
 ./hack
 ./operators/constellation-node-operator
)
```

You can find an introduction in the [Go workspace tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces).

If you have changed dependencies within a module and have run `go mod tidy`, you can use `go work sync` to sync versions of the same dependency of the different modules.

## Recommended VS Code Settings

The following can be added to your personal `settings.json`, but it is recommended to add it to
the `<REPOSITORY>/.vscode/settings.json` repo, so the settings will only affect this repository.

```jsonc
    // Use gofumpt as formatter.
    "gopls": {
      "formatting.gofumpt": true,
    },
    // Use golangci-lint as linter. Make sure you've installed it.
    "go.lintTool":"golangci-lint",
    "go.lintFlags": ["--fast"],
    // You can easily show Go test coverage by running a package test.
    "go.coverageOptions": "showUncoveredCodeOnly",
    // Executing unit tests with race detection.
    // You can add preferences like "-v" or "-count=1"
    "go.testFlags": ["-race"],
    // Enable language features for files with build tags.
    // Attention! This leads to integration test being executed when
    // running a package test within a package containing integration
    // tests.
    "go.buildTags": "integration",
```

## Naming convention

### Network

IP addresses:

* ip: numeric IP address
* host: either IP address or hostname
* endpoint: host+port

### Keys
