## Constellation Terraform Modules

> [!WARNING]
> The Constellation Terraform modules are deprecated, and support will be discontinued in v2.15.0.
> To continue managing Constellation clusters through Terraform, you can use the [Constellation Terraform provider](https://docs.edgeless.systems/constellation/workflows/terraform-provider).
> Clusters created through the Constellation Terraform modules can also be imported to the Constellation Terraform provider.

TODO: Leave a link to the import-docs of the `constellation_cluster` resource, once provider documentation is published.
