Styleguide for this document:

- Sentences should end with a period.
  - This is the keepachangelog style, whereas the Microsoft Style Guide we use for other docs omits periods for short list items.
- Omit the verb if possible.
  - "Early boot logging ..." instead of "Add early boot logging ...".
  - If you need a verb, it should usually be imperative mood (Add instead of Added).
- Items should start with a capital letter.
