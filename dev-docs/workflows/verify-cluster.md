# Verification

In order to verify your cluster we describe a [verification workflow](https://docs.edgeless.systems/constellation/workflows/verify-cluster) in our official docs.
Apart from that you can also reproduce some of the measurements described in the [docs](https://docs.edgeless.systems/constellation/architecture/attestation#runtime-measurements) locally.
Use the provided scripts in `/image/measured-boot` to generated measurements for a built image. Measurements for release images are also available in our image API.
