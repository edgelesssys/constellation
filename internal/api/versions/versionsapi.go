# Versions API

The Versions API provides information about versions of Constellation components.

This package defines API types that represents objects of the versions API.
The types provide helper methods for validation and commonly used operations on the
information contained in the objects. Especially the paths used for the API are defined
in these helper methods.

The package also provides helper functions that can be used in context of the versions API,
e.g. to validate versions.
