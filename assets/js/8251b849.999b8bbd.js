The TCB is the totality of elements in a computing environment that must be trusted not to be compromised. A smaller TCB results in a smaller attack surface. The following diagram shows how Constellation removes the cloud & datacenter infrastructure and the physical hosts, including the hypervisor, the host OS, and other components, from the TCB (red).
