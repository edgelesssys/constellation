# Examples

After you [installed the CLI](install.md) and [created your first cluster](first-steps.md), you're ready to deploy applications. Why not start with one of the following examples?
* [Emojivoto](examples/emojivoto.md): a simple but fun web application
* [Online Boutique](examples/online-boutique.md): an e-commerce demo application by Google consisting of 11 separate microservices
* [Horizontal Pod Autoscaling](examples/horizontal-scaling.md): an example demonstrating Constellation's autoscaling capabilities
