# Troubleshooting

This section aids you in finding problems when working with Constellation.

## Cloud logging

To provide information during early stages of the node's boot process, Constellation logs messages into the cloud providers' log systems. Since these offerings **aren't** confidential, only generic information without any sensitive values are stored. This provides administrators with a high level understanding of the current state of a node.

You can view these information in the follow places:

<tabs groupId="csp">
<tabItem value="azure" label="Azure">

1. In your Azure subscription find the Constellation resource group.
2. Inside the resource group find the Application Insights resource called `constellation-insights-*`.
3. On the left-hand side go to `Logs`, which is located in the section `Monitoring`.
    + Close the Queries page if it pops up.
5. In the query text field type in `traces`, and click `Run`.

To **find the disk UUIDs** use the following query: `traces | where message contains "Disk UUID"`

</tabItem>
<tabItem value="gcp" label="GCP">

1. Select the project that hosts Constellation.
2. Go to the `Compute Engine` service.
3. On the right-hand side of a VM entry select `More Actions` (a stacked ellipsis)
    + Select `View logs`

To **find the disk UUIDs** use the following query: `resource.type="gce_instance" text_payload=~"Disk UUID:.*\n" logName=~".*/constellation-boot-log"`
