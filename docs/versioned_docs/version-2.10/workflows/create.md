Creating your cluster requires two steps:

1. Creating the necessary resources in your cloud environment
2. Bootstrapping the Constellation cluster and setting up a connection

See the [architecture](../architecture/orchestration.md) section for details on the inner workings of this process.

:::tip
If you don't have a cloud subscription, you can also set up a [local Constellation cluster using virtualization](../getting-started/first-steps-local.md) for testing.
:::

## The *create* step

This step creates the necessary resources for your cluster in your cloud environment.
Before you create the cluster, make sure to have a [valid configuration file](./config.md).

### Create

<tabs groupId="provider">
<tabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```bash
constellation create
```

*create* stores your cluster's state in a [`constellation-terraform`](../architecture/orchestration.md#cluster-creation-process) directory in your workspace.

</tabItem>
<tabItem value="terraform" label="Terraform">

Terraform allows for an easier GitOps integration as well as meeting regulatory requirements.
Since the Constellation CLI also uses Terraform under the hood, you can reuse the same Terraform files.

:::info
Familiarize with the [Terraform usage policy](../reference/terraform.md) before manually interacting with Terraform to create a cluster.
Please also refrain from changing the Terraform resource definitions, as Constellation is tightly coupled to them.
:::

Download the Terraform files for the selected CSP from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation/tree/main/cli/internal/terraform/terraform).

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file.
There, define all needed variables found in `variables.tf` using the values from the `constellation-config.yaml`.

To find the image reference for your CSP and region, execute:

```bash
CONSTELL_VER=vX.Y.Z
curl -s https://cdn.confidential.cloud/constellation/v1/ref/-/stream/stable/$CONSTELL_VER/image/info.json | jq
```

Initialize and apply Terraform to create the configured infrastructure:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

The Constellation [init step](#the-init-step) requires the already created `constellation-config.yaml` and the `constellation-id.json`.
Create the `constellation-id.json` using the output from the Terraform state and the `constellation-conf.yaml`:

```bash
CONSTELL_IP=$(terraform output ip)
CONSTELL_INIT_SECRET=$(terraform output initSecret | jq -r | tr -d '\n' | base64)
CONSTELL_CSP=$(cat constellation-conf.yaml | yq ".provider | keys | .[0]")
jq --null-input --arg cloudprovider "$CONSTELL_CSP" --arg ip "$CONSTELL_IP" --arg initsecret "$CONSTELL_INIT_SECRET" '{"cloudprovider":$cloudprovider,"ip":$ip,"initsecret":$initsecret}' > constellation-id.json
```

</tabItem>
</tabs>

## The *init* step

The following command initializes and bootstraps your cluster:

```bash
constellation init
```

Next, configure `kubectl` for your cluster:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG="$PWD/constellation-admin.conf"
```

üèÅ That's it. You've successfully created a Constellation cluster.
