# Supply chain levels for software artifacts (SLSA) adoption

[Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts, or SLSA (salsa)](https://slsa.dev/) is a framework that provides incremental improvements to a projects build system and engineering processes. SLSA focuses on security improvements for source code storage as well as build system definition, execution, and observation. SLSA is structured in [four levels](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/levels). This page describes the adoption of SLSA for Constellation.

:::info
SLSA is still in alpha. The presented levels and their requirements might change in the future. We will adopt any changes into our engineering processes, as they get defined.
:::

## Level 1 - Adopted

**[Build - Scripted](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#scripted-build)**

All build steps are automated via [CMake](https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation/tree/main/.github).

**[Provenance - Available](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#available)**

Provenance for the CLI is generated using the [slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator).

## Level 2 - Adopted

**[Source - Version Controlled](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#version-controlled)**

Constellation is hosted on GitHub using git.

**[Build - Build Service](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#build-service)**

All builds are carried out by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation/tree/main/.github).

**[Provenance - Authenticated](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#authenticated)**

Provenance for the CLI is signed using the [slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator). Learn [how to verify the CLI](../workflows/verify-cli.md) using the signed provenance, before using it for the first time.

**[Provenance - Service Generated](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#service-generated)**

Provenance for the CLI is generated using the [slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) in GitHub Actions.

## Level 3 - Adopted

**[Source - Verified History](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#verified-history)**

The [Edgeless Systems](https://github.com/edgelesssys) GitHub organization [requires two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-two-factor-authentication-for-your-organization/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization) for all members.

**[Source - Retained Indefinitely](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#retained-indefinitely)**

Since we use GitHub to host the repository, it's impossible for an external person to delete or modify the history. Before a pull request can be merged, an explicit approval from an [Edgeless Systems](https://github.com/edgelesssys) team member is required.

The same holds true for changes proposed by team members. Each change to main needs to be proposed via a pull request and requires at least one approval.

The [Edgeless Systems](https://github.com/edgelesssys) GitHub organization admins control these settings and are able to make changes to the repository's history should legal requirements necessitate it. These changes require two-party approval following the obliterate policy.

**[Build - Build as Code](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#build-as-code)**

All build files for Constellation are stored in [the same repository](https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation/tree/main/.github).

**[Build - Ephemeral Environment](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#ephemeral-environment)**

All GitHub Action workflows are executed on [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners). These runners are only available during workflow.

We currently don't use [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).

**[Build - Isolated](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#isolated)**

As outlined in the previous section, we use GitHub-hosted runners, which provide a new, isolated and ephemeral environment for each build.

Additionally, the [SLSA GitHub generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator#generation-of-provenance) itself is run in an isolated workflow with the artifact hash as defined inputs.

**[Provenance - Non-falsifiable](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#non-falsifiable)**

As outlined by [SLSA GitHub generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) it already fulfills the non-falsifiable requirements for SLSA Level 3. The generated provenance is signed using [sigstore](https://sigstore.dev/) with an OIDC based proof of identity.

## Level 4 - In Progress

We strive to adopt certain aspect of SLSA Level 4 that support our engineering process. At the same time, SLSA is still in alpha and the biggest changes to SLSA are expected to be around Level 4.
