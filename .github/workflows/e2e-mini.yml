# The workflow is triggered by the completion of the release workflow.
# It is not called by the release pipeline to allow quicker retrying of failed tests
# The workflow only executes, after being triggered, if the triggering workflow completed successfully.
# e2e-test-release uses the same branch as the triggering workflow and not the commit of the triggering workflow. This is because the release workflow produces further commits.
